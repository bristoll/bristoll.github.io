## About me
I'm a full time software engineer from Spain. 

## Technologies and Philosophy
My expertise and interest lies in back-end technologiees,most of my working day is spent designing and developing APIs. I rarely work in front-end, and when I work on it is always in pages for internal use. I try to focus on building a 1% better software today than I did yesterday. 
My philosophy on learning any new skill, software developing included, is always the same: 

   1. Read some general theory about it (Usually official website)
   2. Look for a basic tutorial so I can see a basic project setted up (The simpler, the better)
   3. Try to replicate that basic project on my own
   4. Rebuild something I've previously built with other language/framework

I really enjoy learning new skills, but I most enjoy trying to teach whatever I just learn. For me this is final step in the learning process, once you are able to teach something you have really learnt it.

## Spare Time
When I'm away from my keyboard I enjoy going out to take a walk in the forest or staying home lied on the sofa with my cat.
